Here are links to resources from different universities that I think are great to refer to while learning compiler design:

I like her explanation of why we do things a certain way. Unfortunately, her courses refers the new edition of the "Dragon" book.

Another course that refers to the new edition. But things like Run-time environment is well explained here:

This site actually does touch by most topics in the textbook:

Things like Bootstrapping can be referred here:

For some reason our course followed the old edition of the "Dragon" book, while I think the new version is much simple and easy to grasp.
