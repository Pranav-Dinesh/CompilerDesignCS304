Here are links to resources from different universities that I think are great to refer to while learning compiler design:

I like her explanation of why we do things a certain way. Unfortunately, her courses refers the new edition of the "Dragon" book.
http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~weile/cs440.540/

Another course that refers to the new edition. But things like Run-time environment is well explained here:
http://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/Teaching/KT1-11/

This site actually does touch by most topics in the textbook:
https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~engelen/courses/COP5621/

Things like Bootstrapping can be referred here:
http://homes.et.aau.dk/akh/2011/complierconst-2011.html

For Operator Precedence Parsers:

http://www.math.uni.lodz.pl/~robpleb/Wyklad_9_ang.pdf

For kernel and non-kernel items:
http://staff.cs.upt.ro/~chirila/teaching/upt/mse11-cd/slides/cd0406.pdf
http://www.cs.nuim.ie/~jpower/Courses/Previous/parsing/node58.html

For Code Optimization:
https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~pandey/Teaching/ECS142/Lects/code.opt.pdf

For some reason our course followed the old edition of the "Dragon" book, while I think the new version is much simple and easy to grasp.
